The FreeBSD drivers are being released as a public preview for evaluation purposes ONLY.\r\n\r\nWe are currently preparing them to be included with FreeBSD as part of the FreeBSD core. In the near future we also plan to release ISO images with preinstalled drivers for the latest releases of FreeBSD. \r\nFor now, our beta quality drivers can be downloaded along with the source code  of FreeBSD 8.2 from this site.\r\n\r\n#### Overview\r\n\r\nWhen installed in a FreeBSD virtual machine running on Hyper-V, the FreeBSD Integration Components provide.\r\n\r\n**Driver support:** FreeBSD Integration Services supports the network controller and the IDE and SCSI storage controllers that were developed specifically for Hyper-V.\r\n\r\n**Timesync:** The clock inside the virtual machine will intially sync with the clock on the virtualization server in preparation for an external clock source \r\n \r\n**Integrated Shutdown:** Virtual machines running FreeBSD can be shut down from either Hyper-V Manager or System Center Virtual Machine Manager by using the “Shut Down” command.\r\n\r\n**Heartbeat:** Allows the virtualization server to detect whether the virtual machine is running and responsive.\r\n\r\n#### Installation Instructions\r\n* [Install FreeBSD 8.2 on Hyper-V on Windows Server 2008/R2](https://github.com/FreeBSDonHyper-V/freebsd/wiki/Provisioning-on-FreeBSD-Virtual-Machine)\r\n* [Install git client] (http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Git_Install)\r\n* [Retrieve and build the kernel with the Hyper-V drivers](https://github.com/FreeBSDonHyper-V/freebsd/wiki/Build-the-kernel-with-the-HyperV-drivers)\r\n\r\n#### How to contact us\r\n* By e-mail <a href=\"mailto:freebsdonhyperv@gmail.com\">freebsdonhyperv@gmail.com</a>\r\n* [By mailing list](https://launchpad.net/~freeonhyper-v)\r\n\r\n"}
